Gringotts bank is still working on their digitalization project, and now
they've put up some new servers. The server was quickly hacked, 
and you've gained access. Unfortunately there's not that much you can do
with your access, except mine MagicCoins, but that's a waste of CPU cycles.

You've heard rumors that the IT-wizards put in a backdoor in case they need
to recover access to the server, maybe you can find it and grab a flag?
