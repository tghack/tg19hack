You remember the acceptance letter? That it had a supply list? Well.. It is 
time to go shopping! All the supplies may be found in the TG:Hack area. Make
sure to stop by the wand shop and buy yourself a wand made by the most

Digitalisation is important even in the life of wizards and witches. TG:Hack
