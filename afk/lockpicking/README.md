Hey, you! Magnificent wizards and witches! Come here.. 
Have you seen the padlocks at the UiO stand and the 
TG:Hack area? These padlocks
have been tampered with so that no wizardry like the 
Alohomora spell will work on them. There is no other way than to
pick the locks like the muggles do. I bet you are no good
without your wand..

If you can pick any of the padlocks, you may ask the muggle 
students for the flag! No magic trickeries to get the flag 
though, be nice to the students.

Remember to ask for help if you are stuck. Picking locks like 
muggles do require a special technique. You may either ask the
UiO students, or the TG:Hack crew for help. We ask you kindly not 
to use force against the padlocks. That will ruin the experience
for all your fellow wizards and witches!
