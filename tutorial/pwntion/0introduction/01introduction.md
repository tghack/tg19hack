# Brewing of Pwntions

Hi there, wizards and witches! Pwntions sounds interesting, eh? Please, enter
my class of introduction to pwntions. I will teach you how to brew pwntions 
to use against vulnerable magical systems, and creatures applying these
systems. In muggle language, brewing such pwntions are called writing exploits. 

_"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe 
this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the 
softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of 
liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the minds, ensnaring 
the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even stopper 
death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."_

## Agenda for the class 
This class has two parts. Firstly, the art of stack overflows is on the agenda.
Stack overflow is an ancient way of making pwntions, and neither wizards or 
muggles have gotten affected by this pwntion in many decades.

<br>

**Class plan:**

| Class topic | Description |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Introduction to the stack | In order to understand stack overflows, you are introduced to the stack and how it is built when running programs | 
| Stack overflow pt. 1 | Overflows for values next to each other on the stack |
| Stack overflow pt. 2 | Overflowing into structs |
| Stack overflow pt. 3 | Overflowing return addresses |

## Exams giving magical XP points
There are three exams related to this class. At the end of each class, you will 
be presented with a new exam that you might be ready to take. All of the exams 
may be found in the pwn category in the tasks page. Here is a list of the 
exams:

| Exam name | Points |
|:---------:|:------:|
| Stack overflow pt. 1 | 50 |
| Stack overflow pt. 2 | 75 |
| Stack overflow pt. 3 | 100 |

Good luck with the class, and please give us feedback so we can improve our class!
