# History of Cryptography

Hello, aspiring wizards and witches! I can see you are 
eager to learn all the secrets of the wizarding world. 
Yes, secrets! That is what this class is all about! Have
you ever wondered how the wizarding world have stayed hidden
from the muggles for so long? Or how the Aurors are able to
communicate without dark wizards knowing? Then you have come
to the right place, for here we will unravel some of
these well kept secrets.

I am Professor Chabz, and together with Professor nic0, I will
give you an introduction to the art of cryptography. Our assistant,
Mr Josefsson, will help us throughout the class to illustrate
problems cryptography can solve. A fair warning before we start: 
cryptography is not for the faint of heart! But persevere and a
master of secrets you can become.

## Agenda of the class
This class consists of three parts. First we will show you how
to do basic _encoding_, then we will move on to _shift ciphers_, and
lastly we will teach you stronger cryptography by using the spell _XOR_.

<br>

### Class plan
| Class topic | Description |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Simple Encoding | You will learn what encoding is and how it can be used. | 
| Shift Cipher | Introducing the concept of secret, you will learn why encoding is not safe and how encryption helps. |
| Stronger Cryptography | You will learn what XOR is and how it can be used to encrypt. |

## Exams giving magical XP points
There are four exams for this class. At the end of each class, you will 
be presented with a new exam that you might be ready to take. All of the exams 
can be found in the crypto category in the tasks page. Here is a list of the 
exams:

| Exam name | Points |
|:---------:|:------:|
| American Standard Code for Information Interchange | 25 |
| Land of Encoding | 25 |
| Rotarius | 25 |
| Exclusive Magic Club | 50 |

Now you are ready to delve into the world of secrets! 
Good luck, my students!
