Congratulations, student! You have been accepted at the TG:Hack School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. Put your tinfoil hats on and join us doing some real awesome (and ethical) magic. It might be a year hard of hard work if you are new to the magic of hacking. But fear not! Our school has tried their best to get awesome professors to teach you these powerful methods of doing magic! Take a look at your acceptance letter and the courses you may participate in at your first year at the School of Witchcraft and Wizardy!

If you have any feedback to make the tasks better for beginners, or if you just want to tell us that you appreciate the tutorial, competition, or a special task, please fill our [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/We7BdVGaB5953S032). 

## Courses
You are enrolled in the three courses Scripting in Pythontongue,
History of Cryptography and Brewing of Pwntions. Scripting in Pythontongue and History of Cryptography does not depend on any other tutorial. However, Brewing of Pwntions depends on the Scripting in Pythontongue course. We recommend that you participate in the lessons in the following order:

1. [Scripting in Pythontongue](https://tghack.no/page/Python%20tutorial): Learning how to code in Python, and using the `pwntools` and `pycrypto` libraries.
2. [History of Cryptography](https://tghack.no/page/Crypto%20tutorial): Learning about simple encoding and encryption.
3. [Brewing of Pwntions](https://tghack.no/page/Pwntions%20tutorial): Learning how to script exploits for stack overflow vulnerabilities in C programs. 

Good luck, students! Keep in mind that you are free to [contact](https://tghack.no/page/Contact) us if you are stuck! One of our professors has a nice saying: _"There is no fun being stuck and  understanding  nothing... So if Google doesn't have the answer, why not ask us?"_
