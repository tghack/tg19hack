# Scripting in Pythontongue

![Python snake](nagini.png)

Welcome to a new year at the School of Wizardry! You wizards and witches
will face many challenges this year. In order to be prepared for these challenges,
we created this class about mythical languages and codes.
Mythical languages can help you on your quest to solve challenges, but first you must be
able to use them.
This year you will learn about a particular language I am sure you have heard about:
_Pythontongue_, or _Python_ for short!


I am professor _Zup_. Professor _PewZ_ and I will be your professors in this class.
The language you will learn has many magical features. If you get good at it,
you can do almost anything you want. Using the _Python_ language you write spells and
codes on script rolls. It is up to you to tell the scripts what to do.

## Agenda for the class

This class will consist of several parts. First you learn how to set up your learning
environment.
After that, there are several parts on how the _Python_ language is structured.
At the end you will be able to solve CTF-challenges by using everything you have learned about
this magical language.

If you know Python, but the Python pwn modules or crypto modules are 
new for you, jump straight to lesson 5 and 6!

| __Boolean operators__, __conditionals__ and __loops__ | Learn about functionality that will help you control the flow in your code. | Professor Zup
| __Functions__, __classes__ and __modules__ | How do you make your code cleaner and more intuitive? Learn about _functions_ and _classes_ | Professor Zup
| __Regular expressions__ | Regular expressions will help you find what you are looking for in a text. Learn about how it works! | Professor Zup
| __File handling__ and __Exceptions__ | Reading and writing to files is really helpful some times. Learn about _file handling_, _context managers_, _exception handling_ | Professor Zup
| Using the __pwn__ module | Using the pwn module to solve CTF-challenges | Professor PewZ

### Exams giving magical XP points
There are four exams related to this class. In the two last parts of the Python 
tutorial, you will be presented with the exams that you might be ready to take. 
All of the exams may be found in the n00b category in the tasks page. Here is a 
list of the exams:

| Exam name | Points |
|:---------:|:------:|
| Echo Chamber | 5 |
| Math Bonanza | 10 |
| Numbers or Bytes? | 15 |
| Let's Hash it Out | 20 |

## Guidelines for code snippets

During each topic, we show you code examples. A single example usually consists
of two code snippets. First the source code, followed by the
output printed when the code is executed. Take a look at the following example:

Here is a snippet of a _Python_ script printing the text "Hello, magical world!"
```python
print "Hello, magical world!"
```
And here is the output of the snippet:
```
Hello, magical world!
```

Keep this in mind throughout the class, I'm sure you'll do great!
